This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Covid19 Stats App #

Our goal is to have a simple web app which offers information about Covid19 statistics per country.

API: https://covid19api.com/

Initial screen should consist of a single button, when clicked, an excerpt of the most recent data for at least 10 countries must be populated as a list.
The user should be able to click on a specific country and get detailed information about that country's current stats on the right side of the page. 
Bellow the detailed view, there should be a button, which offers a modal view and historical data for that country.

User should be able to sort already populated list by the number of infected people. 

The detail and modal views must be accessible by their own unique urls.

UX, styling and attention to detail is up to you.

**Bonus**: 
In DEV Mode Only - Making sure the browser will not do OPTIONS requests in the Network tab when getting remote data via fetch, configured to make POST requests.

### What can be used:
 
* ReactJS
* Redux
* Webpack
* Any other library considered necessary

### What cannot be used
* Any UI libraries (ex. Material-UI)
